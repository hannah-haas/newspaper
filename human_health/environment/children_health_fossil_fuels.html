        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Children are increasingly at risk of prematurely dying from respiratory
          infections. A recent study from the University of Birmingham, University
          of Leicester and Harvard University estimated that 7.2% of respiratory
          deaths in children under the age of 5 can be attributed to PM2.5-related
          fossil fuel burning. Children's brain, lungs and immune systems are very
          susceptible during their early development and can become impaired by
          exposure to air pollutants.
        </p>

        <p>
          PM2.5 is the airborne particulate matter derived from burning coal, petrol
          and diesel, and it has been previously identified as a source of air
          pollution. This study published in 2021 assessed the health impact of
          fossil fuel burning using GEOS-Chem, a satellite simulator used to
          estimate the number of related premature deaths due to global exposure of
          PM2.5 from data collected in 2012.

          Fossil fuels have been historically identified as contributors to disease
          and death. According to research by the World Health Organisation (WHO),
          exposure to low levels of air pollution is a major cause of global disease.
          In 2015, exposure to PM2.5 caused 4.2% death of total deaths; 59% of
          these affecting Asia alone. Although PM2.5 derived from fossil burning
          is a major contributor to air pollution, there are other natural sources,
          including dust and wildfire smoke. In this study, the PM2.5 concentrate
          exposure levels were calculated exclusively from industry derived sources,
          such as those from oil and gas extraction.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The study looked into the effect PM2.5 pollution has in children below
          5 years old developing respiratory infections such as pneumonia and
          bronchitis. This is concerning as children are more susceptible to air
          pollution. The study estimated an average of 7.2% of respiratory mortality
          in children under the age of 5.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Interestingly, Europe was identified as having the largest proportion of
          child mortality in relation to to fossil fuel pollution by 13.6%, thus,
          there is a clear need to tackle this problem at a local level.
        </p>

            Estimated annual excess deaths due to exposure to PM2.5 generated by
            fossil fuel burning. The largest contributors of ambient PM2.5 in
            2012 were China and India, these are the same regions with expected
            increased excess mortality | Vohra, 2021

        </figure>
        </br>
        <p>
          In 2012, India and China were shown to be the biggest contributors to
          PM2.5 in the atmosphere. North America and Europe were also shown to be
          significant contributors, the latter found to be adding to the pollution
          of the North African coastline. The study estimated that globally
          <strong> 10.2 million premature deaths annually are attributable to
            fossil fuel combustion, which would be the equivalent of 21.5% of
            all deaths annually. </strong>
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The solution to this problem is clearly the reduction of an over-reliance
          on fossil fuels. Fossil fuel burning is not the only source of pollution
          which affects human health, but is far more controllable compared to
          natural sources , such as wildfire smoke.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The data in this study reflects global fossil fuel combustion in 2012,
          since then, China has applied measures to decrease fossil fuel emissions.
          These reductions led to a 30–50% decline in PM2.5 from 2013 to 2018,
          which has led to a drop in premature deaths from 10.2 million to 8.7
          million annually.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          It is evident that government policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel
          combustion have a real-life impact in the reduction of premature deaths.
          This evidence shows the benefits of investing in greener and alternative
          energy sources.
