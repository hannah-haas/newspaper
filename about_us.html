        We are a group of postgraduate university students with a passion for the environment and wildlife conservation! We strongly believe that the communication gap between scientists, policymakers and the general public is a large reason we fail
        to
        protect the environment. We launched this newspaper to highlight the multifaceted issues behind conservation and hope for our readers to understand the importance of our global ecosystem.

              <p>Having grown up in Switzerland to German-American parents, I have
                been fortunate to live so close to iconic natural landscapes. The
                steady return of wolves to Switzerland after being hunted to
                extinction, is what sparked my interest in wildlife conservation
                from a very young age. Ever since I’ve wanted to ‘give back’ to the
                environment, in order to try to repair the damage humans have done.
                I have completed a BSc Biology at the University of Bristol, where
                I also worked as the Head Science and Technology Editor at the
                student newspaper Epigram. This definitely grew my interest in
                science communication! Alongside The Kingfisher, I am undertaking
                an MSc in Environment, Politics and Society at UCL.</p>

                I have always been in love with the outdoors, and in the past several
                years I have been more active in learning about and taking action in
                conservation and sustainability. I want to be able to have a positive
                impact on others and create a space for them to also be able to learn
                and take action. With an interest in creating change, building new
                things, and a love for science and technology, I decided to study
                Computer Science. I graduated in 2021 with a BS in Computer Science
                from Brown University with a focus on systems, security, design, and
                machine learning. With these skills, I aim to build The Kingfisher
                into a place where individuals from all around the world can
                come for information on the environment and human health.

                The ability to be able to communicate with people from all over the
                world has always been of importance to me. This led me to gain fluency
                in Spanish and Portuguese by completing a BA Modern Languages at the
                University of Bristol. I chose to enhance my language skills by
                currently undertaking my Masters in Translation and Professional
                Language Skills (TPLS) at the University of Bath. Along with picking
                up French and German, I have gained skills in editing and revision,
                proofreading and précis writing. With these qualifications, I aim
                to help publish high quality articles on environmental conservation.
                In tandem with The Kingfisher, I aim to offer my translation
                and editing services with a focus in the environmental sector.
