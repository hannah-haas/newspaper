        We are a group of postgraduate university students with a passion for the environment and wildlife conservation! We strongly believe that the communication gap between scientists, policymakers and the general public is a large reason we fail
        to
        protect the environment. We launched this newspaper to highlight the multifaceted issues behind conservation and hope for our readers to understand the importance of our global ecosystem.

              Having grown up in Switzerland to German-American parents, I have been fortunate to live so close to iconic natural landscapes. The steady return of wolves to Switzerland after being hunted to extinction, is what sparked my interest in
              wildlife conservation from a very young age. Ever since I’ve wanted to ‘give back’ to the environment, in order to try to repair the damage humans have done. I am currently completing my BSc Biology at the University of Bristol, where I
              also worked as the head Science and Technology Editor at the student newspaper Epigram. This definitely grew my interest in science communication! Alongside The Kingfisher, I plan to next undertake a Masters in Environmental Policy.

              I am a science writer covering topics on human health affected by
              climate change and pollution. I moved to the UK from Venezuela in
              2013, and I have a background in Cellular and Molecular Medicine
              (BSc) and Cardiovascular Medicine (MSc). I have previous experience
              writing for the University of Bristol newspaper, Epigram on SciTech
              topics including COVID-19, research involving Big Data and data
              sharing, and the NHS.

              I have always been in love with the outdoors, and in the past several
              years I have been more active in learning about and taking action in
              conservation and sustainability. I want to be able to have a positive
              impact on others and create a space for them to also be able to learn
              and take action. With an interest in creating change, building new
              things, and a love for science and technology, I decided to study
              Computer Science. I graduated in 2021 with a BS in Computer Science
              from Brown University with a focus on systems, security, design, and
              machine learning. With these skills, I aim to build The Kingfisher
              into a place where individuals from all around the world can
              come for information on the environment and human health.

              The ability to be able to communicate with people from all over the
              world has always been of importance to me. This led me to gain fluency
              in Spanish and Portuguese by completing a BA Modern Languages at the
              University of Bristol. I chose to enhance my language skills by
              currently undertaking my Masters in Translation and Professional
              Language Skills (TPLS) at the University of Bath. Along with picking
              up French and German, I have gained skills in editing and revision,
              proofreading and précis writing. With these qualifications, I aim
              to help publish high quality articles on environmental conservation.
              In tandem with The Kingfisher, I aim to offer my translation
              and editing services with a focus in the environmental sector.
