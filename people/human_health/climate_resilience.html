        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Places around the world are being affected by climate change through
          devastating floods, wildfires and extreme heat-waves. Many healthcare
          facilities are simply not prepared and there is therefore a pressing
          need to address this through awareness of climate resilience.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Climate change has impacted the prevalence of infectious diseases,
          such as dengue, malaria and zika virus, which has sparked a rise in
          cases during periods of increasing temperatures and rainfall. The
          effect of climate change and diseases has been taking its toll on
          healthcare facilities’ ability to deliver safe and reliable services.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Professor Guy Howard is the Global Research Chair in Infrastructure
          and Environmental Resilience and Associate Director (International) of
          the Cabot Institute of the Environment at the University of Bristol.
          Addressing the concerning threat of the lack of resilience within
          healthcare services and the challenges ahead, he highlighted four key
          components of healthcare facilities: the health workforce; water,
          sanitation and healthcare waste management; energy; and infrastructure,
          technology and products.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The resilience of each element is crucial in the process of
          administering aid to those who come into hospitals and other healthcare
          facilities. An individual admitted to hospital without access to
          toilets and clean water to wash their hands will have their health
          compromised through coming into contact with an unsafe health service.
          Add more problems such as a tired workforce and unreliable
          power-generating system and an unforeseen climate event may collapse
          the whole service.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Professor Howard goes on to explain why having climate-resilient and
          safe health services is so important. First, in ideal conditions,
          very few services in the world have all four mentioned components to
          secure a safe and resilient environment for patients. Additionally,
          around 900 million people in the world use facilities with no access
          to clean water, the equivalent to 4% of hospitals.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          There is a major challenge for those services which are already
          lacking basic resources such as water, sanitation and thermoregulation
          (cooling systems or heating) – the latter has become increasingly
          significant since many buildings that are designed for cold weather
          cannot withstand the extreme temperatures seen recently due to global
          warming.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Additionally, there are many climate threats, including wildfires,
          droughts, and floods, which will physically impact healthcare
          facilities around the world.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">
          Wildfires are the biggest threat to healthcare facilities in Australia and the USA.

        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Resilience in healthcare matters
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The concept of resilience goes hand in hand with sustainability,
          because resilient services and infrastructure can cope with ‘stresses’
          and ‘shocks’ that may put many hospitals out of service and bring harm
          to the most vulnerable people.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Professor Howard explains that resilience is about response -
          authorities are much quicker to address shocks to services which are
          perceived as dramatic or imminent. For example, devastating floods
          alarm the authorities and the public, and because they often lead to
          disasters, such as power outages and bridge collapses, everyone is
          forced to act quickly. Unfortunately, at this stage it is too late to
          take any significant preventative measures and many lives are sadly lost.

            Doctors and healthcare workers were not prepared for the events that
            took place at Memorial Medical Centre, New Orleans on 29 August 2005.
            Hurricane Katrina flooded the hospital, there was no electricity, no
            food or water. Temperatures rose to 43°C for several days which ended
            in the most vulnerable patients being euthanized due to lack of
            preparedness and understanding of how to respond to this type of
            disaster | Bill Haber / AP file.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </br>
        <p>
          On the other hand, responding to stresses does not necessarily make
          the authorities aware of the problem. An example of this is when there
          may be a temporary heatwave, in which services are put under stress,
          but not enough to evoke much-needed changes to infrastructure so as to
          avoid a power failure, for example. In these cases, Professor Howard
          marks the importance of efficient thermoregulated buildings and
          contingency plans for power outages.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          In summary, it is easier to respond to shocks than to stresses,
          however with stress, people are less likely to wake up to the problem
          due to its long-term nature. By changing our focus to address stresses,
          we can ensure that we create resilient and strong services, which are
          better prepared for the shocks.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Both shocks and stresses impact the healthcare system by adding strain
          to workers who are already over-worked and to the infrastructure, by
          damaging life-saving equipment, lifts to safely transfer patients and
          by cutting off water and sanitation.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          In June 2021, an unprecedented heat wave put an immense strain on US
          and Canadian services. A measure of preparedness for the disaster was
          observed through the set-up of cooling centres across the affected
          regions. These centres sheltered citizens from the heat, and may be a
          useful strategy in preparing for future heat waves in places not
          accustomed to such high temperatures.

          Tackling a lack of resilience within healthcare facilities
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Facilities may wish to reinforce their current basic services such as
          ensuring a clean water supply, optimizing food and sanitation and
          preparing their workforce through relevant training and communication.
          The WHO Operational Framework currently offers recommendations into
          these preparedness solutions and additional information on how to get
          support to tackle a lack of resilience. Unfortunately, however, many
          communities around the world do not have the resources to achieve such
          improvements.

          Low-income and rural communities are the most at risk due to a lack of
          basic coverage of healthcare services. The UN and the 17 Sustainable
          Development Goals (SDGs) agree that adopting climate resilient
          healthcare facilities is part of the same strategy to end poverty and
          reduce inequalities. By aiming to execute the SDGs, there may be hope
          to relieve some suffering on less-developed populations regarding the
          vulnerability of their healthcare facilities to climate change.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Professor Howard and colleagues acknowledge that the lack of basic
          coverage needs to be tackled, and help address proposals by the WHO
          guidelines for climate resilience. For example, in areas affected by
          drought, hospitals may look to adapt to collect rainwater during the
          rainy season through the use of certain water towers (image below). In
          reality, however, these recommendations are not universally suitable,
          as raised towers may not be appropriate for certain local climates,
          and could easily collapse during a hurricane due to its structural
          design. More climate (and regional) appropriate measures should be
          carefully explored to protect low-income and rural communities in the
          event of future natural disasters.

          Climate resilience and preparedness are both environmentally
          sustainable measures. Ensuring services run with clean water and
          sanitation may also contribute to a healthy environment through the
          reduction of pollutants. This may also be true as services deprived of
          water and sanitation often become the sources of infectious diseases.
          Additionally, running safe services benefit all people, especially the
          most vulnerable patients, as well as allowing the workforce to
          withstand future emergencies.

        <p>
          Climate resilience emphasises the importance of preparedness and
          awareness towards climate change and its effects on worldwide
          healthcare facilities. The lack of resilient healthcare facility
          measures may become a source of stress and cause healthcare workers to
          be unprepared to tackle shocks, such as a flood or drought. On the
          other hand, it may be also important to recognise that in richer
          countries, implementing climate resilience means to lower the release
          of contaminants into the air and environment, which will reduce the
          risk of diseases through better waste management. To conclude, without
          resilient healthcare services and facilities, the health and well-being
          of the world’s population is undoubtedly at risk, particularly when
          facing the consequences of climate change.
