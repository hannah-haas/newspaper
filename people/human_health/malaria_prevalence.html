          A new study predicts that melting glaciers in the North Atlantic will
          cause a shift in malaria prevalence and transmission across the
          African continent. The length of disease transmission is expected to
          decrease across West Africa, where malaria is currently most prevalent,
          and will begin affecting the malaria-free zones of the East African highlands.

          Human malaria is caused by five species of <i> Plasmodium,</i> an obligate
          parasite which has caused 1.5 billion cases of malaria and 7.6
          related-deaths worldwide since the year 2000. The most dangerous
          species of malaria is <i>Plasmodium falciparum,</i> which has been
          responsible for 50% of all malaria cases.

        <p>
          Due to its warmer and more humid climate, malaria is most prevalent in
          Western Africa. Data collected between 2000 to 2017 have found that
          93% of cases and 94% of malaria-related deaths worldwide occur in the
          African continent. The main vectors which carry malaria in the most
          affected regions of Africa are the female mosquitoes of the species
          <i>Anopheles funestus.</i>
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Malaria is climate sensitive and its transmission is seasonal, hence
          any changes in climate can quickly increase or decrease the threat
          that this disease poses. <i>Anopheles funestus,</i> and other
          <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito vectors of malaria, thrive in environments
          that have above 40% humidity in the air.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The incubation period of these mosquitoes, which is the time frame for
          when the female mosquito becomes infectious, shortens with increasing
          temperature. Past studies have observed that the minimum temperature
          required for the <i>Plasmodium</i> to mature in certain mosquitoes is 17°C.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Thus, the prime regions for malaria to thrive and therefore pose the
          greatest threat to human health, are those climates which experience a
          temperature range between 17°C to 38°C, and with a humidity of above
          40%. As of 38°C, <i>Anopheles mosquitoes</i> rapidly die, killing the
          vector and ultimately stopping transmission.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Who is currently worst affected by malaria?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          With the average global temperature increasing, the areas where
          malaria is most prevalent may shift to different geographic locations.
          Currently, many parts of Africa, Southeast Asia and South America are
          most affected.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The Malaria Atlas Project, a database which tracks malaria incidents
          and deaths worldwide, has recorded that the disease is most widespread
          across Central Africa. Areas with over 70% disease prevalence are
          Burkina Faso, Southern Guinea, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
          Mozambique. Regions surrounding these locations vary between 30% to
          60% in prevalence.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Prevalence rates approach zero north of the Sahel, which is the
          climatic transition between the densely vegetative Congo Basin and the
          dry, hot Sahara Desert. Other areas with very low prevalence rates are
          East Africa, as well as Southern Namibia, Botswana and South Africa.
          However, regions where the <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito vectors are
          present, but too cold for <i>Plasmodium</i> development and
          transmission, are likely to become more at risk when their climates
          experience increased temperatures.

          How do melting glaciers affect malaria distribution across the African continent?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Chemison and colleagues published a paper in
          <a target="_blank" style="color: rgb(150, 186, 143);" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24134-4.pdf"> <i>Nature</i></a>
          on 25 June 2021, which compared the projections of different climate
          models on how malaria may be affected by anthropogenic climate change.
          However, unlike previous studies, the team investigated how the
          melting ice-sheets and permafrost all the way in the Arctic Circle
          could influence the climate-sensitive mosquito vectors in Africa.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The meteorological system is not isolated to countries or continents,
          and thus the smallest change or imbalance in one corner of the globe
          can impact the climatic conditions in another. A large regulator of
          global weather patterns is the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
          Circulation (AMOC). The AMOC is a system of strong Atlantic Ocean
          currents, which play a significant role in transporting heat, carbon
          and freshwater worldwide.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Currently, the AMOC is driven by strong currents in the Southern
          Hemisphere, which push warm water into the Northern Hemisphere and
          redistribute heat. This causes the cold, dense waters in the North
          Atlantic to sink, as warm water from the Southern Hemisphere reaches
          the Northern Hemisphere and redistributes heat. As a result, water
          vapour from the North Atlantic moves eastwards over Europe and Central
          Africa via various wind currents.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘The AMOC is slowing down due to increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          During the past century, researchers have found that the AMOC is
          slowing down due to increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
          The increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has caused a rise in
          the water surface temperature of the North Atlantic Ocean, resulting
          in more freshwater entering the ocean system from melting ice sheets.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Lead author Chemison explains that, ‘An additional supply of
          freshwater in the Northern Atlantic would lead to a decrease in the
          density of the cold surface water […] This effect would further slow
          down the AMOC.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The change of behaviour in ocean current speeds and evaporation rates
          of the AMOC, can in turn alter rainfall and temperature trends over
          the African continent. As malaria is a climate sensitive disease, its
          range and transmission rates will follow suit.

        <p>
          Today, malaria occurs in regions with temperatures ranging between
          22°C to 30°C, and with high rainfalls reaching between 100 to 300
          millimetres per month. Areas free of malaria are those which
          experience temperatures below 20°C or above 32°C, with little rainfall
          of less than 50 millimetres per month.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          A climate model, known as the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5
          (RCP8.5), estimates the impacts of anthropogenic climate change in a
          very high baseline emission scenario. RCP8.5 projects an increase of
          malaria prevalence in East Africa—a region currently with very low
          prevalence—to around 60%, and that the length of the transmission
          season will exceed 10 months.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          However, one should note that many have critiqued this model, as it
          takes a very aggressive stance when quantifying fossil fuel use in the
          future. It models the extreme scenario, where no environmental
          policies are successfully being implemented in order to hinder an
          average 1.5°C to 2°C temperature increase.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘East Africa, currently a region with very low malaria cases, is projected to increase to 60% malaria prevalence.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          For this reason, the team compared the results of RCP8.5 with several
          other models. They found that a series of Mathematical Malaria Models
          projected the same increase in East Africa as the RCP8.5, and that
          this increase may occur as early as the 2040s.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Ethiopia, which is currently considered to be a relatively lower risk
          country, at 8.56% prevalence below 2000 meters altitude, is expected
          to reach a prevalence of 18%, with a transmission season said to last
          three months during the 2040s. This change is associated with a
          projected 3°C temperature increase and 40 millimetres of rainfall per
          month in Ethiopia in the coming years.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          On the other hand, according to the Mathematical Malaria Model, the
          Sahel and Southern Africa are expected to have a decrease in Malaria
          prevalence. This is because although there is also a projected
          temperature increase of 1°C, the climates of these regions are very
          arid and already exceed 30°C; creating an environment where
          <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes are unable to survive.

        </br>
        <p>
          When the team compared these malaria distribution projections to
          another model known as ICE1m, they found some contradictions. ICE1m
          is a model which considers the additional influence of rapid ice-sheet
          melting, such as the Greenland ice sheet, in its calculations.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          ICE1m predicts a southward shift of the African rain-belt with the
          slowing of the AMOC, which would mean that although it aligns with
          the other two models, predicting that malaria prevalence will increase
          in East Africa, it differs in that it also expects an increase in
          Southern Africa—due to increased humidity.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The ICE1m model aligns with both the RCP8.5 and Mathematical Malarial
          Models in that the malaria cases will decrease in the Sahel, even
          reaching simulated prevalence rates of -4% to -8%. Essentially
          creating new malaria-free zones.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Whilst these climate models provide much insight in what the future
          may hold, there is evident discrepancy in some of their contrasting
          outcomes. The full impact of a continuously slowing AMOC is
          understandably hard to predict with complete certainty, as global
          meteorological systems are extremely sensitive and intricate.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Future health and social impacts on East and South Africa
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Each year, over 400,000 people die from malaria. Aside from the huge
          health and social impacts that malaria has on people threatened by
          this disease, it also has an economic impact. According to the Center
          for Disease Control and Prevention, direct costs of battling this
          endemic (i.e. treatment, healthcare, premature death) are estimated to
          be $12 billion per year.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          However, there are also indirect costs associated with the disease,
          as those ill with malaria and those who die can cause a dent in the
          work forces of countries with a high malaria prevalence, thus impeding
          potential economic growth. According to Gallup and Sachs (2001), the
          economic growth of countries five years after eliminating malaria,
          was significantly higher than countries which still battle it.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘Direct costs of battling this endemic are estimated to be $12 billion per year.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Overall, multiple models have agreed in their prediction that there
          will be an eastward and likely southward shift in areas that will be
          worst affected by malaria across the African continent. Countries with
          low prevalence now will need to anticipate a changing future, by
          allocating funds and infrastructure to malaria prevention, diagnosis
          and treatment.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          West and Central Africa, which currently face the brunt of the malaria
          endemic, may be alleviated in future. However, this does not mean
          that the enemy is gone, it has just moved to a new battleground. It
          is the highlands of East Africa that may need to prepare for the
          future battle.
