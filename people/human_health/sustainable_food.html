          Current research emphasises the promotion of plant-rich diets to
          combat climate change, through a transformational shift in the current
          food system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimise
          the water footprint and waste.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Dr Pauline Scheelbeek, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
          Medicine, presented a talk in March at the University of Bristol on
          climate change mitigation through changes in our food system. She
          outlined that the food system encompasses everything from farming,
          food production and packaging, to consumption and food waste. The
          current food system has a considerable impact on greenhouse gas
          emissions—in total contributing between 21% to 37%—with about 31% of
          these emissions being attributed to livestock and fisheries alone.

            The current food system has an impact on greenhouse gas emissions
            and approximately 31% of these emissions can be attributed to the
            meat and fish industry. Recent research proposes a movement to a
            more sustainable diet, increasing vegetable and legumbre production
            will, not surprisingly, slow down the current climate crisis |

        <p>
          This highlights the problems of a meat- and dairy-based diet, and how
          the demand of which is negatively affecting the climate. A meat-based
          diet, in particular, is not only unsustainable, but a huge contributor
          to health problems; specifically being linked to the growing cases of
          obesity worldwide. In the United Kingdom alone, the rate of obesity
          and those overweight is 64%.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Dr Pauline Scheelbeek, an Assistant Professor in Nutritional and
          Environmental Epidemiology, who also has a background in food system
          programmes, emphasises the benefits in tackling all parts of the food
          system, in order to reduce the impact of the current climate crisis.
          Changes to the food system and its effects on climate can be addressed
          at every step of the chain, in particular at the consumption level.
          The question is, is the impact of the current food system a direct
          result of the consumer? And if so, is it the people's responsibility?
          Unfortunately, the answer may not be that simple.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘The food system encompasses everything from farming, food production and packaging to consumption and food waste.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The food system and its effects are also influenced by how the food
          industry promotes certain products to consumers. We know this, since
          the consumption of many of these products do not contribute to a
          healthy lifestyle. The most accessible products are often the ones
          most detrimental to our physical health, such as processed foods that
          can cause conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Dr Scheelbeek
          also emphasizes other global health impacts of the current food system
          at the other end of the spectrum, such as anemia, micronutrient
          deficiency and stunting.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Another important aspect to consider is how the current system serves
          the environment. Research has shown that the food industries, such as
          the meat and fish industry, have been considerably taxing to the
          environment in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, water footprint and
          waste.
        </p>

            A change from the current food system through the adoption of various
            other systems showed the predicted effects in reducing greenhouse
            gas emissions. The bar in ‘light green’ shows what could happen if a
            rich plant diet was adopted globally , this can be compared to the
            black bar labelled ‘Business-as-usual’ which is the current system |

        </figure>
        </br>
        <p>
          Dr Scheelbeek’s research promotes the scaling up of fruit and vegetable
          consumption. This means that adopting a sustainable diet through
          increasing the consumption of vegetables and fruits may help mitigate
          climate change. However, this can also be promoted earlier on in the
          production chain, through encouraging an increase in horticulture
          practices within countries. The improved use of land and water would
          thus contribute to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Recent studies into food systems and its effects in decreasing or
          slowing the rise of the global average temperature, suggest that the
          most effective change in food systems may come from the adoption of a
          plant-rich diet. This behaviour-change approach may also help in the
          reduction of water and waste.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘The current food system uses 70% of the global freshwater resources.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The current 5 a day recommendations of a nutritional and balanced diet,
          which is currently promoted by the UK government, may not be enough to
          create the transformational change in mitigating climate change.
          Scheelbeek’s research draws on the Eatwell Guide (EWG) recommendations
          set out by government bodies, which promote the consumption of
          vegetables and legumes in the UK. The EWG also suggests reducing the
          consumption of meats and high-sugar foods, due to their connection to
          cardiovascular diseases and cancer.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          However, there are also concerns that the public may struggle to adhere
          to a more demanding government-approved diet. Dr Scheelbeek’s study
          found that those who have a medium-to-high adherence to the EWG manage
          to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than those with poorer
          adherences to this diet. Adherence to the EWG has also shown many
          health benefits.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the food system. Of
          these, 31% comes from livestock and fisheries, 27% from crop production,
          24% land use and 18% from the supply chain.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Scaling up the production of vegetables and fruits will require the
          expansion of its farming through increased implementation of
          horticulture across the UK. In order to alleviate our impacts on the
          environment, the UK Government will need to actively invest in
          horticulture production at a national level, including start-up
          <a target="_blank" style="color: rgb(150, 186, 143);" href="https://sustainablefoodtrust.org/articles/vertical-farming-and-hydroponics-on-the-spectrum-of-sustainability/"> vertical
            farming and hydroponic technologies.</a> Dr Scheelbeek’s research also
          found additional positive effects on countryside biodiversity with this
          type of shift in food production and farming.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Increasing the production and consumption of fruit and vegetables,
          whilst decreasing investment into livestock agriculture, may be the
          solution for both climate change and population nutritional deficiencies.
          Our global community needs to be encouraged to make transformational
          changes of the food system, both on an individual and systemic level,
          in order to reduce global emissions and mitigate climate change.

        <p>
          Sustainable diets, through the increase of production and consumption
          of fruit and vegetables, may be the solution for both climate change
          and population nutritional deficiencies. The UK and the rest of the
          world need to be encouraged to make transformational changes of the
          food system to reduce global emissions and mitigate climate change.
          Consumers may also contribute to the mitigation of these factors
          through the adoption of a plant-rich diet. Additionally, the population
          will benefit from a disease preventing diet if more people consider
          adhering to the EWG. However, the benefits may not be enough solely
          from the consumer level and governments need to commit to
          transformational changes along the current food system.
