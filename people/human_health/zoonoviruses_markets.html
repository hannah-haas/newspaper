          Survey-based data collection has suggested that negative public
          perception towards wildlife trade, exotic wildlife consumption and
          bats has significantly increased. 46% of participants believe that
          disease transmission due to close contact between humans and exotic
          wildlife will continue to cause future pandemics.

          It has been nearly one-and-a-half years since what most of us thought
          would be ‘some isolated virus in China’ has turned out to devastate
          the entire globe. Since its first case in Wuhan, China, COVID-19, also
          known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2
          (SARS-CoV-2), has spread to 223 countries and territories.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          As of June 2021, there have been around 182,300,000 cases and 3,948,000
          deaths worldwide (according to the John Hopkins University tracker).
          It is the largest pandemic in modern history, since the Spanish
          Influenza (1918 to 1920) and the recent Ebola virus (2014 to 2016). What do
          all these pandemics have in common? They are all suspected to have
          originated from animals.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘They are all suspected to have originated from animals.’

          Zoonotic diseases are viruses, bacteria and pathogens which are
          transmitted from animals to humans during close contact. It is
          believed that 60% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in
          nature—whilst researchers estimate that a further 650,000 to 840,000
          existing zoonotic pathogens have not yet crossed from their animal
          hosts into humans.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Instances where transmissions tend to occur have been traced back to
          activities such as wildlife trade, wildlife consumption and even
          habitat destruction. Many studies have evidence indicating that bats
          may act as a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses, as
          coronavirus samples taken from a horseshoe bat showed to have a
          genome that was 96% identical to the SARS-CoV-2 virus currently
          spreading through humans.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          However, bats are not the only source of zoonotic viruses, as SARS-CoV
          has also been identified in civets and pangolins sold in Chinese wildlife
          markets. Even the Ebola virus is thought to have been transmitted to
          humans when people handled and consumed infected wildlife carcasses,
          particularly those of apes.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          How has COVID-19 affected public perception towards wildlife markets?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          A WWF survey conducted in China, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and the
          United States, one year on from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,
          found that 30% of questioned participants have significantly decreased
          or stopped consuming wildlife products due to the pandemic.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          In all five surveyed countries, 85% of participants said they would
          support government action to shut down wildlife trade and 88% supported
          the stopping of deforestation. Two months after the initial outbreak
          of COVID-19, the Chinese government imposed a nation-wide ban on the
          consumption of wildlife products. In the WWF survey, 91% of the
          Chinese participants agreed that this would be an effective measure
          to stop future pandemics.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Another survey questioning Chinese participants with a higher education,
          conducted by Manman Lu and colleagues in August 2020, found that
          negative attitudes towards bats significantly outweigh positive attitudes.
          In the nine months since COVID-19 began and the time they were
          interviewed, the negative attitude towards bats increased by 14.7%.
          The team also found that those who exhibited this view are also more
          likely to support ecological culling and less likely to support bat
          conservation efforts.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Overall 93.8% of the participants still opposed human consumption of
          bats and bushmeat, likely due to the fact that the majority of the
          participants believed that it is bats that are highly likely to be
          responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19. The results from both surveys
          show a contrast between the negative attitude towards bats, in a rare
          culture that has actually praised them in the past.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Although the majority of the public believes that bats are responsible
          for the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been no proof of a direct link
          between the two. The coronavirus exhibited in bats may have a similarity
          to SARS-CoV-2, but there is no evidence that it was bats which
          transmitted SARS-Co2-2 to humans, nor that they carry this specific
          virus themselves.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          This shows how the media can distort public perception; skewing
          statements such as ‘bats may be a natural reservoir for harboring
          SARS-CoV-2-like viruses’ to ‘Chinese man in Wuhan ate bat soup and
          caused the outbreak of COVID-19’.

          Bats: another victim of the COVID-19 pandemic
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Public perception is often detrimental towards conservation efforts,
          as for them to work in the long term, one needs the support of its
          local people. Bats are vital ecosystem services, acting as insect
          controllers, pollinators and seed dispersers.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          In general, bats have not always had the best reputation amongst humans.
          From their unique but perhaps not-so-pretty appearance, to their role
          in deep-routed vampire folklore and blood consumption—they are commonly
          not someone’s favorite animal.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          However, as most other wild animals, the survival of bats is at risk
          due to habitat destruction, hunting and even wind energy production.
          Thus, convincing people on their ecological importance has proved not
          to be the easiest task—particularly now since they are believed to be
          the ‘culprit’ of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          In the past, smaller disease pandemics—mostly those of which have
          affected livestock—have attempted to be controlled via ‘ecological
          culling’. This is the complete destruction of the vector (i.e. animal)
          thought to be transmitting the disease and thus hindering any further
          uncontrolled spread. Since the start of COVID-10 some regions in China
          and Indonesia have implemented this strategy.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          These practices are injurious to wildlife conservation efforts! Bats
          are a very diverse group of animals, containing around 1400 known subspecies.
          One thousand of these species are under threat, requiring both
          conservation efforts and more research. Ecological culling practices
          would result in the destruction of a species that has not been proved
          to have caused the pandemic, aside from the fact that most of the bat
          species likely do not even harbor a coronavirus.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Legal wildlife trade may pose a greater threat than illegal wildlife trade!
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          <i> Illegal </i> wildlife trade is not the only market policies should focus on
          in order to prevent future zoonotic pandemics. An animal is an animal,
          whether it is deemed a ‘legal commodity’ or not. A pathogen cannot and
          will not distinguish between the two.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Prof. Vincent Nijman, Professor of Anthropology at Oxford-Brookes
          University, argues that legal trade poses a greater threat than illegal
          wildlife trade. Unlike livestock trade, both legal and illegal wildlife
          trade undergo little regulations—legally traded wildlife is handled no
          differently to illegally traded wildlife in terms of disease spread.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The United States, for example, does not have specific laws on
          surveying wildlife products which enter the country; so, most imports
          are not tested for disease presence. The United States Department of
          Agriculture only imposes disease checks if there is a prior risk believed to
          be associated with agricultural livestock products.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Wet markets, such as the Wuhan market in China, where COVID-19 is
          believed to have originated, mostly sells non-domesticated,
          <strong> legal </strong> wildlife products. It is the lack of hygiene
          regulations in these markets which foster an ideal environment for
          disease transmission.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘A pathogen cannot and will not distinguish between the two.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          National Geographic Journalist, Jonathan Kolby, described how
          approximately 200 million live animals are imported legally into the
          US each year. His experience as a past wildlife specialist and policy
          advisory for the Fish and Wildlife Service, showed him that although
          there is much focus on regulating the volume of illegal international
          wildlife trade imports—often enough the zoonoviruses which enter the
          country via legal products go unnoticed.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Legal wildlife trade is also a much larger market than illegal trade.
          While illegal Wildlife trade generates a revenue of $7 to $20 billion
          annually, being the third most expensive illegal market after drugs and
          weapons trade, the monetary value of the legal wildlife market is up
          to four times that, meaning it poses four times the threat.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Increased commercialization of wildlife allows larger scale and faster
          disease transmission. Data collected which observed the animals present
          in illegal wildlife trade, found that 88% of these species matched
          those which are listed as possible vectors in the zoonotic disease
          datasets. Thus, Clean Trade programs should be encouraged, so that
          imported wildlife products must also be accompanied with a health
          certificate, as is in the case for imported livestock.

          How can we prevent another global zoonotic pandemic?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Addressing how we currently conduct land-use change and wildlife trade
          will not only impact future disease transmission, but also a whole
          array of other environmental issues. Whilst many governments, such as
          China, believe a nationwide shutdown of wildlife markets is the way
          to go, some policymakers believe that shutting down in-person markets
          will just push them online to the dark web, where trafficking activity
          is even more difficult to trace.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Additionally, a ban of all markets could undermine human rights and
          risk exacerbating poverty, as many of these markets are legal. Wet
          markets are simply a place where fresh produce is sold and should not
          be synonymized with wildlife trade, as these are mostly associated with
          illegal activity. Millions of urban and rural people rely on wet
          markets for their food and livelihood.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Whilst wildlife trade gives products to the elite class—an aspect of
          the trade which should be banned—it offers food security to some of
          the country’s poorest people. Many rural communities, even indigenous
          groups, rely on selling and consuming wildlife products, as well as
          forest flora products. Thus, an overall ban could push people out of
          these jobs and achieve the opposite effect by increasing means to
          survive through illegal measures.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘When it comes to decisions on policies to do with these issues, it
          is vital to have the democratic engagement of locals.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          People should have the right to own, manage and use their traditional
          lands in a sustainable way. Instead of banning wildlife trade
          completely, indigenous communities should be used as examples of how
          they have traditionally used their lands for thousands of years.
          Sustainable wildlife trade can increase incentive for locals to protect
          their local biodiversity, as its health is vital to keep the trade going.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Whilst heavy regulations should be introduced into wildlife trade, it
          is important to include locals in the discussion and have their voices
          heard. Meetings should be held to spread awareness on the consequences
          of uncontrolled wildlife trade, biodiversity loss and how zoonotic
          diseases spread. When it comes to decisions on policies to do with
          these issues, it is vital to have the democratic engagement of
          locals—introducing voting on possible policy changes and hearing the
          advice of indigenous leaders.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Partnerships should be introduced between local communities, the
          private sector and the government in order to implement measures to
          prevent and control future zoonotic disease outbreaks. Whilst
          introducing COVID-19 recovery funds should occur at a local level,
          international collaboration between governments is key to isolate a
          potential future pandemic.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Collaboration and the sharing of data is much more important than
          competition for which country releases a successful vaccine first.
