          An international collaborative study found that mercury levels in
          Greenland glacial meltwater compare to levels measured in industrial China.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The Greenland Ice Sheet is the second largest ice sheet Earth, covering
          25% the Arctic region’s terrestrial surface. Much research has
          established that this ice sheet is losing mass at a very high rate,
          with this rate accelerating annually in line with the Earth’s rapidly
          changing climate.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The devastating loss of polar glaciers is a hallmark of climate
          change—causing the habitat loss of the iconic animals that live there
          and threatening our coastline cities with rising sea levels. The team
          embarked on their research journey to the Arctic, with the intent of
          studying how the nutrients of Greenland glaciers could possibly
          sustain coastal ecosystems. However, they were shocked by their findings.

          The levels measured in the fresh, natural Greenland glacial meltwater
          contained mercury levels as seen in polluted, industrial rivers in
          China. Whilst the team expected the presence of mercury in the samples,
          as it is typically found in many rivers, it was completely surprising
          to see a concentration that high.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          A normal range of dissolved mercury in rivers is between one to 10 ng/L,
          however those found in the Greenland meltwater was 150 ng/L. Water
          samples from <em> glacial flour</em>—areas of particularly high erosion—contain
          mercury levels up to 2000 ng/L.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          This study collected water samples from the Watson River, Isortoq River,
          Russell Glacier, Søndre Strømfjord and Kangerlussuaq in Greenland.
          Until now, only a few studies in Canada, Alaska, the Himalayas and
          some areas elsewhere in Greenland have been identified as natural
          mercury stores.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          ‘We didn’t expect there would be anywhere near that amount of mercury
          in the glacial water there,’ said co-author Dr Rob Spencer, Associate
          Professor of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science at Florida State University.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Why is mercury in the ice sheets?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Whilst concentrations of mercury run-off have significantly increased
          due to industrialization, the element also occurs naturally in the
          environment. It is common for mercury to enter the environment through
          volcanic emissions, as well as the weathering of rocks which contain
          the element.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Multiple studies have all observed the recent trends of the increase
          of mercury in the Arctic waters, however it was largely uncertain what
          the source of these high concentrations were. Some studies linked the
          higher presence of mercury in the Arctic waters to atmospheric
          circulations which carry mercury to this region; although this new
          discovery in Greenland now reveals how large of a role glacial
          meltwater plays in influencing ocean water biochemistry.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Whilst the source of mercury in the Greenland Ice sheet itself is
          unknown, John Hawkins believes, ‘it is very likely coming from the
          local rock itself, as opposed to a fossil fuel combustion or other
          industrial source.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Another 2016 study by Soerensen and colleagues found that a third of
          mercury in the Arctic water column comes from terrestrial environments.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          What is Mercury and why is it so dangerous?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Mercury is a heavy metal and toxic in even small doses. Though the
          severity of symptoms depends on the level and duration of the exposure.
          However, a more toxic form of mercury is the neurotoxin methylmercury.
          This is because methylmercury is also absorbed more easily than
          inorganic mercury and can thus access the body to a greater extent.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Methylmercury is produced by bacteria who live in the sediments at the
          bottom of the ocean, which extract inorganic mercury from the water
          column and ‘methylate’ it (i.e. add a methyl molecule to it). This
          metabolic process is not well understood by scientists and it has been
          difficult to identify the genes associated with it.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, DNA metagenomic analysis carried out on meltwater samples
          have suggested that many of the sub-glacial microbial communities in
          Greenland are actually able to cope with mercury toxicity. These
          microbes have a special ‘mercuric reductase’ enzyme, which allows
          them to remove the methyl group from methylmercury and convert it back
          to its slightly less toxic form mercury (though still toxic!).
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘Methylmercury is also absorbed more easily than inorganic mercury.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          However, this pathway is very poorly understood, as it has been assumed
          that it is also these communities which are methylating the inorganic
          mercury in the first place! The team also found that there was also a
          higher proportion of methylmercury in the fjørd surface waters than in
          other regions of glacial meltwater. This may indicate that the
          bacteria responsible for the methylation of mercury may live in higher
          concentrations in fjørd sediments.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Soerensen and colleagues found elevated methylmercury levels in the
          Arctic Ocean but could not account for its source. The team quotes: ‘
          Riverine methylmercury inputs account for approximately 15% of inputs
          to the surface ocean, but of greater importance in the future is
          likely given increasing freshwater discharges and permafrost melt.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          It is therefore important for more research to be conducted in this
          area—the Greenland study showed just how much mercury is currently
          locked up in our ice sheets! The more ice that will melt due to the
          warming climate, the more mercury will enter the ocean and provide
          these microbes a lot more ingredients to produce methylmercury.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          What will happen if it enters the aquatic food chain?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Methylmercury tightly binds to fish proteins, entering the fish’s body
          either through their gills or through consumption of smaller prey.
          According to analysis conducted by the Department of Environmental
          Conservation in Vermont, methylmercury levels bioaccumulate one
          million times higher in certain carnivorous fish, when compared to
          the levels in the surrounding water.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The bioaccumulation of methylmercury does not only pose a health risk
          to animals, but to the people who rely on the Arctic fishing industry.
          Consumption of products which contain unsafe levels of mercury can
          lead to methylmercury poisoning.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          According to UCSF Health, this poisoning can lead to blindness,
          cerebral palsy, deafness, impaired mental function, growth problems,
          lung impairments and small heads in newborns. Unborn babies and
          infants are particularly vulnerable to methylmercury, as pregnant
          women consuming unsafe products are at high risk of passing this
          toxin on to their child through their placenta.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Although, whilst the symptoms cannot be reversed, they usually do not
          get worse unless the individual is exposed to more methylmercury.

          Future implications
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The recent study by Hawkings and colleagues took samples from meltwater
          rivers that drain a 4000 kilometer<sup>2</sup> area of the Greenland
          ice sheet and the two fjørds. The more climate change prevails, the
          more mercury will be unleashed into Arctic coastal regions.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          So far, policies involved in managing the level of toxic elements in
          the environment, such as mercury, are surrounding industrial sources.
          Policies must be put into place to even keep ‘naturally occurring’
          mercury locked up in their reserves.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          This once again comes down to nation’s needing to meet their net-zero
          emissions targets, in order to limit any more temperature increases.
          This is not a Greenland-isolated issue—atmospheric temperature is
          influenced by the entire globe.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Melting glaciers will cause a lot more devastation than ‘just’ rising
          sea levels. Our current global ecosystem has adapted to the delicate
          biochemical balance of the Earth and atmosphere over millions of
          years—everything is fine-tuned to thrive in precise conditions.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          So, even if the Greenland ice sheet is a store for ‘natural mercury’,
          it is human-driven activity which is causing elements to go places it
          should not be in the first place!
