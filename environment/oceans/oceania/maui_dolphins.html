        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Two of the world’s smallest dolphins have been listed as endangered and
          critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of
          Nature (IUCN). The populations of Hector’s and Māui dolphins are dwindling,
          with only around 10,000 Hector’s and a mere 63 Māui dolphins, respectively.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The IUCN, IWC Scientific Committee, WWF and a multitude of New Zealand-based
          conservation groups are calling for stricter measures to be set in place
          for the protection of the two dolphin species. If immediate action is not
          taken soon, the Māui dolphin will be extinct in less than a decade, with
          the Hector dolphin soon following suit.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Hector’s and Māui dolphins are endemic to New Zealand waters, meaning it
          is the only place in the world where they can be found. The two black and
          white dolphins appear identical, standing out with a uniquely rounded
          dorsal fin, however their genetic differences classify them as two separate
          species.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The small population of Māui dolphins can be found on the west coast of
          the North Island of New Zealand, between Maunganui Bluff and Whanganui.
          They live in shallow waters, which are usually no more than 20 meters deep.
          The Hector’s dolphins, on the other hand are more widespread, living off
          the coasts of both the North and South Islands of New Zealand.
        </p>

        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Why are there only 63 Māui dolphins left?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Since the widespread introduction of gillnets in the 1970s and the
          increased trawling in the 1980s, the Māui dolphin population has
          diminished from 1500 individuals to the 63 claimed to exist today – a
          number that itself could in reality be much lower. Currently, numbers of
          Hector’s dolphins are thought to only be one-fifth of the 50,000 individuals
          present in the 1970s.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The main threat to these endemic dolphins, as well as many other cetaceans
          around the world, is becoming by-catch of fisheries. By-catch is defined
          as all non-target species caught in a fishing catch. This occurs because
          cetaceans are also after fish, so when many fish are being caught in the
          net that fishermen set, it naturally attracts the predators of those fish
          as well.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Fisheries use many different methods to catch seafood; drift sets are
          placed near the sea surface on currents, gillnets are suspended between
          the sea surface and the seabed, and set nets are fastened to the seafloor
          to catch demersal fish. Another more destructive method of fishing is
          previously-mentioned trawling, where a ship drags a large weighted net
          along the bottom of the ocean.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          What’s the problem with these fishing practices?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Most fishing practices are non-specific, meaning they catch anything and
          everything that happens to be in the way of the nets. Trawling causes
          severe habitat destruction along the bottom of the ocean. The dragging of
          the heavy-chained nets not only catches fish, but all other species that
          reside on the ocean floor, sediments, corals, sponges and more.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Furthermore, nets cannot be detected via echolocation, a sound-based method
          of navigation used by cetaceans and therefore causing them to be at high
          risk of being caught in the nets. Studies have found that gillnetting and
          trawling have caused the highest rates of by-catch, and set nets have been
          directly linked to 58% of Hector’s and Māui dolphin deaths.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          In a 20-year period (1998 to 2018), the New Zealand government determined
          that 107 of 317 reported Hector dolphin deaths were a result of entanglement.
          For a further 126 Hector dolphins, the cause of death could not be determined.
          In the same period, five of twenty reported Māui dolphin deaths were due to
          entanglement, whilst they could not determine the cause of death for a
          further seven.
        </p>

        </figure>
        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Why are cetaceans specifically vulnerable?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          An additional issue is that cetaceans, such as the Hector’s and Māui
          dolphins, are described as ‘k-selected species.’ These are species that
          generally have stable populations, slower rates of maturity, lower numbers
          of offspring and higher investment in parental care. Examples of such are
          whales, dolphins, elephants, humans, etc. The opposite ‘living strategy’
          of animals are ‘r-selected species’, who have quicker rates of maturity,
          high numbers of offspring, quick population turnovers and little parental care.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          As k-selected species, female Māui dolphins first reproduce at seven to
          nine years of age, and only reproduce every two to four years. The
          population growth of the two dolphin species is very slow, and so any
          reduction in numbers is hard for the population to recover – especially
          if the individual dies before reaching sexual maturity.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Cetaceans are highly social, intelligent mammals with a complex population
          structure. Pods of dolphins and whales tend to include ‘key individuals’,
          such as a leading matriarch or perhaps an individual that links different
          population groups. If you remove one of these key individuals from a
          population, then the whole social dynamic can fall apart.
        </p>
        </br>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          What actions have been proposed to protect the critically endangered Māui dolphin?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          A recent 2020 proposal, aimed to protect the remaining dolphin populations,
          has urged the government of New Zealand to extend and create new areas to
          prohibit the use of commercial and recreational set nets in North and
          South Island. It specifically called for the prohibition of trawling in
          central Maui, where the 63 Māui dolphins live, as well as the use of drift
          nets in all New Zealand waters.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Most areas where Māui dolphins live already have set net and trawling bans,
          however their broader habitat extends into areas which don’t (from Cape
          Reinga to Cape Egmont). Thus, new commercial and recreational set net
          restrictions were proposed in the following areas of the west coast of
          the North Island:
        </p>
        </br>
        <p style="margin-left:25px;">
          1. Four nautical miles offshore between Cape Reinga and Maunganui Bluff.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:25px;">
          2. Four nautical miles offshore between Hawera and Wellington.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:25px;">
          3. Two to seven nautical miles offshore between the Waiwhakaiho River in
          New Plymouth and Hawera.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:25px;">
          4. Seven to twelve nautical miles between Maunganui Bluff and the
          Waiwhakaiho River in New Plymouth.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:25px;">
          5. Extend the closures into the Manukau Harbour to Taumatarea Point and
          Matakawau Point.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:25px;">
          6. Additionally, commercial trawling closures should be extended to
          between Maunganui Bluff and Pariokariwa Point.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Another vital change is that fishing policies need to limit fishing-related
          mortalities to zero dolphins within the Māui dolphin habitat zone. The
          by-catch limits placed on fisheries and other human activity are known as
          a ‘maximum sustainable yield’, which determines the number of animals which
          can be killed without driving a population towards extinction. As the Māui
          dolphin population is at a mere 63 adult individuals, the species cannot
          afford anymore ‘allowed’ deaths.
        </p>

        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          What new measures have been approved and put into action by the New Zealand government?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Since the 1 October 2020, new fishing rules have been put into place in
          order to reduce the threats on Hector’s and Māui dolphins. In the central,
          Auckland and Kermadec fishing areas, set nets are largely prohibited and
          the ban on trawling has been further extended into the Māui dolphin
          habitat zone. The proposal was also successful in banning all drift nets
          in all fishing areas in New Zealand.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          In terms of set nets, the Ministry for Primary Industries only implemented
          the proposals No.2, No.3 and No.4 from the list above. However, there are
          still no net restrictions between Cape Reinga and Maunganui Bluff, which
          is part of the greater habitat area of the Māui dolphin. Instead, they
          proposed the transition to ring-netting in these areas, which does not
          pose a risk to dolphins.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          In addition, in the areas which do allow set nets, they must not be baited,
          exceed 60 meters in length or be set within 60 metres of another net.
          Securing nets with stakes have now also been banned and no fisherman may
          set or possess more than one set net.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The hope is that implementing these new suggestions will allow the Māui
          dolphin population and the Hector’s dolphin populations to increase to
          95% carrying capacity of environment and 90% of carrying capacity of
          environment, respectively.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          What do these new restrictions mean for New Zealand’s fishing industry?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Implementing these measures will likely cost commercial fishers NZ $5.58
          million, as they will have costs for the purchasing of new gear and
          travelling to other areas where set nets are allowed. The monarchy will
          not pay compensation for these changes.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The new restrictions on the fishing industry should not have an effect
          on the ‘total allowable commercial catches’ per year, just in the ways
          and areas these are to be caught. However, until now, the waters in which
          the Hector and Māui dolphins reside, have brought in NZ $50 million per year.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          It is also expected that these measures will cause a NZ $2.15 million
          revenue loss annually from set nets and NZ $1.82 million annual loss from
          the trawling bans. Economists estimated that a low impact on the economy
          after five years would be NZ $11.27 million from set nets and NZ $9.53
          million from trawling. Whereas a high impact estimate is NZ $27.07 million
          from set nets and NZ $22.89 million from trawling after five years. One
          can therefore understand the oppositions that the implementation of these
          policies face, due to the security of many livelihoods that they threaten.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          A particular group threatened by the new fishing restrictions are the
          indigenous Māori people. Fishing was a major trading industry between Māori
          communities before the arrival of European colonists. Having experienced
          years of exploitation and territory loss, it was only until the Treaty of
          Waitangi (1840), where the Māori gained full and undisputed claims over
          their fisheries.
        </p>
        </br>
        <figure>
          <img class="article_photos" src="./images/SamuleSun_Unsplash.jpg">
          <figcaption> Small fishing vessels. | Samule Sun/ Unsplash </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </br>
        <p>
          However, since, the guarantees ensured by this treaty continued to be
          breached, and indigenous people kept seeing their fisheries degraded and
          depleted of resources. Today, after centuries of fighting for rights and
          settlements, the Māori control around 30% of New Zealand’s commercial
          fisheries. The New Zealand Parliament also approved the distribution of
          fishery assets to the Māori, which has been overseen by the Te Ohu Kei
          Moana, a marine fishing organization which protects the rights of
          indigenous Māori people.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Now, the new regulations put in place to protect the Hector and Māui
          dolphins will affect at least five iwis (local Māori groups) in the North
          Island. Although there are many Māori who are open to altering their
          fishing practices in order to minimize the impacts on dolphins, there are
          twenty Māori-owned fishing companies on the West Coast which will take a
          major hit. Despite their good intentions toward dolphin conservation, the
          new laws undermine the fishing rights and compensations that the Māori
          had been previously promised.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The New Zealand government is currently revising a ‘transition package’ of
          approximately NZ $75,000, in order to support both Māori and other fishing
          businesses affected by the new changes. These will either be through a
          one-off payment to the most affected fisherman or funding to offset the
          transition costs for them to change to dolphin-friendly fishing methods.
          Nonetheless, short-term payments will not rectify the loss of security that
          they will face in their current livelihoods.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          What else is being done?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          In order to reduce by-catch in fishing practices, localized solutions need
          to be created. One needs to first determine the scale of the impact, by
          assessing natural versus unnatural deaths of the Hector’s and Māui dolphins,
          as well as the size of the impacted population. Using this, one can then
          calculate the robustness of the population, which is the ability for the
          given population to absorb the impact. In the case of Hector’s dolphins,
          there may still be some leeway, however the Māui dolphin cannot allow any
          more human-induced deaths.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Some fisheries around the world have begun to install by-catch reduction
          devices in their trawl nets, which have shown to be able to decrease
          by-catch by up to 45%. These devices aim to prevent larger animals from
          drifting to the back of these nets, by having an escape hatch where the
          animals fall out. Although many of the cetaceans that fall out are injured
          or dead, the instalment of an escape hatch has largely reduced the number

          Other devices have included acoustic deterrent devices, which are attached
          to nets and emit sounds which the dolphins can detect. The IWC Scientific

          north and south populations of Hector’s dolphins, in order to allow for
          healthy gene flow.

          fishing in the Māui dolphin habitat area.
