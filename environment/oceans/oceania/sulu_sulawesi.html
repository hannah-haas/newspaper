          Currently 5% of our oceans are actively protected, by 2030 Conservation
          International hopes that 30% of marine areas will be under protection.
          The establishment of seascapes may just help shift current marine
          economies into sustainable ‘blue’ economies.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Building blue economies—the ocean equivalent of a green economy—requires
          an approach that integrates both ecosystem health and human health into
          its management framework. Seascapes are multiple-use areas, which
          include both marine protected ‘no-take’ areas (MPAs) or areas which are
          heavily regulated to ensure sustainable resource use.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Regulatory frameworks surrounding seascapes are mainly guided by
          scientific research, which involves close collaboration with other
          sectors that generate their revenue from these areas. Seascapes are
          funded by governments with territory in the area, private organizations
          and other stakeholders, in order to conserve biodiversity, whilst
          promoting human health.

          Shannon Murphy, seascape manager at Conservation International: ‘The
          key to success lies in creating an environment where all of the moving
          pieces including governments, local communities, funders and NGOs work
          together to balance protection and production of ocean resources for
          the health of the planet and its people.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Conservation International is currently operating as a ‘backbone organization’
          in five established seascapes: Sulu-Sulawesi Seascape (bordering northern
          Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines), Bird’s Head Seascape (boarding
          west Indonesia), Lau Seascape (bordering Fiji’s Lau Islands), The
          Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape (bordering Columbia, Ecuador and the
          Galapagos Islands) and the Abrolhos-Trindade Seascape (bordering Brazil).
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The role of a ‘backbone’ organization is to coordinate partners working
          within the seascape. The seascape approach recommends that any future
          established seascapes also have a reliable ‘backbone’ organization,
          which is not a governing body, to offer neutral guidance. This is because
          seascapes are often transboundary, crossing both national and international waters.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          The Sulu-Sulawesi Seascape
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The Sulu-Sulawesi seascape was established in 2005 and covers a 900,000
          kilometers<sup>2</sup> area which overlaps the coral triangle. Therefore, the
          Sulu-Sulawesi is one of the most diverse and productive marine areas.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          One million people rely on the seascape area for their livelihoods,
          whilst a further 35,147,864 million people live within ten kilometers
          of its coasts, thus deriving most of their food from it. The Sulu-Sulawesi
          area has around 50 MPAs, which has seen a 79% increase in no-take areas
          (no organisms or natural resources are removed from the area) since
          prior to its establishment.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          At the COP 10 conference in 2010, the involved parties (The Philippines,
          Malaysia and Indonesia) collaborated on a series of
          <a target="_blank" style="color: rgb(150, 186, 143);" href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/29160/ssme-action-plans.pdf">
            comprehensive action plans</a>
          for the Sulu-Sulawesi Seascape. The three
          overarching conservation themes in the Sulu-Sulawesi are the conservation
          of: (1) Threatened, Charismatic and Migratory Species, (2) Marine Protected
          Areas and Networks, (3) Sustainable Fisheries.

          How to establish a long-lasting seascape
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Currently, the Sulu-Sulawesi Seascape has a total investment of $10 to 50
          million. For a seascape to function in the long-term it needs both public
          incentive and legislative support. Rules surrounding seascape areas must
          therefore be integrated into the social and political frameworks of nations as well.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Governing bodies, educational and research institutions need to allocate
          a certain budget to financially support multidisciplinary research into
          effective seascape implementation, management and monitoring. To achieve
          this, proper awareness and communication are also necessary, in order
          to shift stakeholder thinking and investment from exploitative resource
          use to sustainable practices.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          All of the current seascapes—aside from Lau Seascape—which are monitored
          by Conservation International, were established with the financial support
          of a committed donor. This allowed the seascapes to be managed with a
          certain flexibility, when planning regulatory frameworks, conducting
          research and building further partnerships.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Surveys found that whilst a core donor may be successful in setting up
          the seascape, it may create an uncertain dependency on that source of
          funding. Thus, funding for seascapes should come from the public sector,
          the private sector and revenues derived from the seascape itself (i.e.,
          tourism, sustainable commercial fishing, any natural resource extraction, etc.)
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘For a seascape to function in the long-term it needs both public incentive and legislative support.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Sulu-Sulawesi was successful in transforming its funding sources, from
          a sole donor to multiple contributors. In 2005, the seascape was
          established with 95% of its funding coming from philanthropic sources,
          and only a 5% contribution from the Indonesian, Malaysian and Philippine
          governments. However, after much public engagement and raising awareness
          on the importance of protecting these areas, as well as the potential
          revenues from tourism and sustainable fishing practices, funding sources
          shifted over time.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Over a period of 13 years, the Sulu-Sulawesi Seascape built partnerships
          with multiple bilateral and multilateral institutions, as well as increasing
          government funding as well. In 2018, Sulu-Sulawesi received nearly 60%
          of its funding from its bordering governments, around 12% from academic
          institutions and around 20% from the public sector. What started out
          to be 95% philanthropically driven, is now only contributing to 5% of
          the total Sulu-Sulawesi funds.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The three governments need to continue to allocate a large budget to
          the Sulu-Sulawesi seascape. Whilst donors, such as aid agencies,
          international banks and large corporations, should also readily provide
          funds in grants or loans to those who protect the environment, rather
          than those who exploit it.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          What is Line 5?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          There are multiple ways in which the Sulu-Sulawesi seascape generates
          revenue in order to support its own conservation efforts. User fees
          are a large source of money, where individuals or commercial organizations
          are charged a certain fee in order to enter the area. For example,
          ‘green fees’ are mandatory payments for scuba divers who want to explore
          MPAs or tourists who want to enter Sulu-Sulawesi via boat.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Additionally, it is common practice to implement registration and
          licensing fees for commercial fishers who wish to fish outside designated
          MPAs but still within the borders of Sulu-Sulawesi. Usually licenses
          are priced quite low, but it is important to increase them within
          seascapes in order to be able to estimate the economic rent of the
          fishing industry. By estimating the money earned which exceeds the
          economically or socially necessary amount, one can control overfishing.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Seascapes should also only offer a maximum number of licenses in the
          area, in order to further limit the parties who operate within them.
          These can be allocated yearly, seasonally or monthly, to certain
          industries, depending on the product they fish. However, these prices
          and number of licenses need to be balanced against equity and poverty
          alleviation objectives, as most of the local fishers are amongst the
          poorest citizens. Licensing fees could thus be offered in larger
          quantities and for slightly cheaper to rural and subsistence fisheries,
          and in less numbers and higher prices to larger, commercial fishing entities.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Governments also need to increase taxes on products stemming from
          unsustainable practices, in order to shift incentive for producers to
          operate with sustainable practices or aquacultures instead. These may
          also include pollution charges, as a compensation for the damage
          unsustainable fishing practices cause to ‘the environment and society’.
          Significant penalties and fines are also mandatory if any laws of the
          Sulu-Sulawesi are broken.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          If enough revenue is generated from the Sulu-Sulawesi, it will encourage
          increased external investment from stakeholders, which would in turn
          lead to a self-sustaining cycle of maintaining these areas.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          A seascape that supports human health and livelihoods
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The majority of commercial practices in these seascape areas should be
          reserved for local industries, rather than international giants. If
          the livelihoods of local, coastal communities are protected and
          prioritized, it also increases incentive for them to recognize the
          value of conserving their ecosystem services. Additionally, increasing
          taxes on international products, as well as limiting seascape activity
          to primarily locals, will reduce competition from international markets.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Partnerships with educational institutions and research centers are
          also vital to encourage both marine and human health. Educational
          programs in schools and field trips to the seascapes would forge an
          interest and relationship in younger people—which should be exempt
          from the tourism fee.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Additionally, the organizations working within the Sulu-Sulawesi should
          provide a secure job market for young, national science graduates, in
          order for them to work to conserve their own environment. This puts the
          responsibility of nature conservation in the hands of its own locals,
          rather than having for the most part, foreign researchers come in to
          ‘manage’ other people’s waters.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘If the livelihoods of local communities are prioritized, it will
          increase incentive to recognize the value of conserving their ecosystem services.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The Sulu-Sulawesi is a leading example of a forward-thinking ocean
          conservation strategy. Whilst areas of high marine biodiversity should
          be prioritized, it is important to consider establishing seascapes
          along major migration routes as well.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Along with the other five seascapes established by Conservation International,
          other international organizations and nations should look to establish
          their own seascapes along their coastlines. Multidisciplinary research
          and cross-sectional collaboration is vital to conserve biodiversity and
          ecosystems, whilst providing sustainable food and a stable livelihood
          to its people.
