          The Amazonian rainforest is vital to mitigating the impacts of climate
          change. However, findings suggest that, due to ongoing human disturbances,
          deforested areas of the world’s largest rainforest are not recovering
          at a fast-enough rate.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          A collaborative study between the University of Bristol and Brazil’s
          National Institute for Space Research, have determined that different
          drivers are linked to the regional variations in forest regrowth within
          the Amazon. The paper, published in Nature Communication on 19 March
          2021, used four decades worth of land satellite data in order to measure
          the age, type, aboveground carbon levels and human activity of its forest canopy.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Just last year, images exposing the extensive burning of the Amazon
          rainforest spread like wildfire across global media. Despite the claims
          from President Jair Bolsonaro that these were false, Brazilian scientists
          themselves published data directly linking the fires to the agricultural
          slash-and-burn practices set by loggers and cattle ranchers.

        <p>
          By taking up three per cent of terrestrial land, the Amazon rainforest
          surpasses any other in being the largest continuous tropical forest on
          Earth. Forests act as a carbon sink and are estimated to be able to
          mitigate a quarter of the measures set under the Paris agreement. Often
          referred to as the ‘Earth’s lungs’, the Amazon itself stores 10 percent
          of global forest carbon.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The remote sensing technique allowed the research group to continue to
          collect data during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which Brazil has been
          particularly hard hit. The data provided evidence for significant
          differences in growth rates between three types of forests in the
          Amazon: Old primary forests, young secondary forests (less than 20
          years old) and older secondary forests (above 20 years old).
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right"> ‘The Amazon itself stores 10 percent of global forest carbon.’ </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Lead author and PhD student from the University of Bristol, Viola Heinrich,
          explained: ‘This type of approach using regional and global remote
          sensing products has not been attempted before to such a high spatial
          resolution. The models have the potential to benefit both the carbon
          modelling and carbon-policy communities to help understand the regional
          variations of regrowth under different drivers.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Old primary forests are those which are untouched and exist in their
          original state. According to Mongabay, they are ‘often characterized
          by a full ceiling canopy and usually several layers of understory.’
          Young, secondary forests are forests that have been disturbed in one
          way or another, mostly through human activity. Therefore, they lack
          a full canopy, have less tree density and allow much light to reach
          the ground, often leading to overgrowth of ground-level vegetation.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Secondary forests currently take up 20 percent of the Amazon’s area.
          They often are part of a five to ten-year cycle of being cleared for
          agricultural purposes and then abandoned, when the soil becomes
          depleted of any nutrients and thus insufficient for crop growth.
          Despite the fact that young secondary forests have great regeneration
          potential, they are not protected by any policies. Therefore, they
          are constantly prone to being deforested before they can reach the
          ecological potential of primary forests.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p> <strong> Primary findings of the researchers </strong> </p>
        <p>
          The overriding anthropogenic cause for slower growth rates of
          secondary forests were those which grow on land which experienced
          multiple deforestation events through the use of slash-and-burn
          practices. This is due to its degradation of seed banks, soil nutrient
          content and water availability. The team found these growth rates to
          slow by 20 to 50 per cent.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The use of the slash-and-burn technique clears sections of rainforest
          and fertilizes it by burning pre-existing plants, then planting the
          crop of choice. However, the land only remains suitable for around
          two to three years, before the soil becomes degraded. The farmer moves
          on, but often returns to repeat this cycle every five to ten years later.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The team found geographic variations in the effects human disturbance
          has on reforestation rates, which may provide guidance for which
          areas are of priority for conservation. Secondary forests in the eastern
          regions of the Amazon seem to be more affected by slash-and-burn
          techniques than the western regions, slowing growth by 20 percent and
          50 percent, respectively. This is likely due to the wetter climate of
          the western Amazon.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Additionally, the southern region of the Amazon, also known as the
          ‘Arc of Deforestation,’ is at a higher risk than the north, due to
          its drier climate. Here, growth rates averagely decrease 40 to 50 per
          cent due to human activity. The findings, therefore, indicate that the
          South-Eastern forests of the Amazon are in need of most urgent protection.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          It was also concluded that it takes secondary forests a minimum of
          100-years to achieve the above ground carbon (AGC) potential of older
          forests. AGC refers to the fraction of carbon stored in tree biomass.
          Thus, their findings suggest that young, secondary forests (less than
          20 years) do not match older primary forests in their ability to
          mitigate the impacts of climate change.

        </br>
        <p> <strong> Implications for conservation policies </strong> </p>
        <p>
          The researchers suggest that Brazil must implement policies that focus
          on conserving both older, secondary forests (above 20 years) and old,
          primary forests. It is vital to allow secondary forests to reach the
          full AGC storage potential of primary forests. If they are constantly
          felled through slash-and-burn practices, the AGC potential of secondary
          forests is likely to plateau at 40-years of age.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The ecosystem services these forests provide are extremely undervalued.
          Currently, less than one per cent of secondary forests above 20-years
          old are preserved. It is estimated that anthropogenic disturbances in
          the Amazon has already caused an eight per cent loss in total potential
          2017 carbon stock.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The team believes the conservation of these older secondary forests
          are key to climate change mitigation solutions in the long run, whereas
          conserving older primary forests are critical to meeting policy-relevant timescales.
        </p>

        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘There is no mention of the 12 million hectares that had been
          [previously] committed to reforestation.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Taking immediate action to preserve the current secondary forests
          could contribute to six percent of Brazil’s net emissions reduction
          targets. These estimates do not even include the potential of re-growing
          secondary forests, which Heinrich believes, ‘could help Brazil reach
          its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) goals of reducing net
          national emissions by 43 percent in 2030.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          However, just in December 2020, Brazil amended its pledge (NDC) under
          the Paris Agreement. There is no mention of the 12 million hectares
          that had been committed to reforestation in 2015. On 9 April 2021,
          Vice President Hamilton Mourão released Brazil’s plan towards mitigating
          deforestation in the Amazon throughout 2021 to 2022.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Vice President Mourão recently stated that legalizing mining in the
          gold-rich indigenous lands of the Amazon would reroute illegal mining
          activity in protected areas. He believes that those mining would comply
          with environmental laws set out in those legalized areas. However,
          environmentalists say that this would only increase illegal logging
          and commercialize traditional indigenous lands, breaching their
          livelihoods and rights.

          According to the National Institute for Space Research (Instituto Nacional
          de Pesquisas Espaciais – INPE), 7,500 km<sup>2</sup> of the Legal Amazon was
          deforested in 2018. The new Amazon Plan of 2021/2022 still allows 16
          per cent more deforestation than in 2018, which is the year before
          President Bolsonaro took office. This means that this new plan claiming
          to mitigate deforestation is not as ambitious as the government makes
          it out to be, as it would still allow around 8,700 km<sup>2</sup> to be deforested
          in the next year.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Rates of deforestation in the Legal Amazon drastically increased when
          President Jair Bolsonaro took leadership of the country in 2019.

            Brasilis,</a> an online portal set up by the INPE to display up-to-date
          data on the Amazon, shows that the rainforest lost 10,100 km<sup>2</sup> in 2019
          and another 11,100 km<sup>2</sup> in 2021. Most of the deforestation taking
          place in these years have occurred in the Pará state, in the north of
          Brazil.

            Amazon Plan for 2021/2022</a> is very vague and does not outline any
          specific measures on how to target illegal deforestation; which
          mostly stems from mining, soy and cattle ranching. The policy brief,
          which came into action upon its publication on 9 April 20201, intends
          to merge together agencies in order to mitigate deforestation. It
          also aims to create ‘bio-economies’; an alternative source of income
          for those communities residing within and around the rainforest, via
          further developing their healthcare and infrastructure.

        </br>
        <p>
          Particularly during COVID-19, conservation priorities have been pushed
          even further back, as Brazil is struggling to alleviate the pressures
          which the pandemic has placed on its economy. It is believed that the
          Bolsonaro administration is also using the COVID-19 as a distraction,
          in order to reverse previously pledged environmental regulations.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          According to the Climate Action Tracker, Brazilian legislators have
          recently fast-tracked the approval of handing over highly controversial
          ownership of illegally deforested land. This rollback and gap in
          much-needed policies will likely cause even higher rates of
          deforestation and hinder decarbonization of Brazil’s economy.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          ‘Brazil is likely to be the tropical country with the largest potential
          for this kind of Nature-based solution, which can generate income to
          landowners, reestablish ecosystems services and place the country
          again as a global leader in the fight against climate change,’ explains
          co-author of the study, Dr Luiz Aragão, National Institute of Space
          Research in Brazil.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Brazil needs to become incentivized to shift to a green economy, as
          sustainable management of the Amazon rainforest has the possibility
          of being a huge source of revenue for the country.
