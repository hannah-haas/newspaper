        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Under the guidance of the BioTrade Initiative, the Eudafano Women’s
          Cooperative, a community organization in Namibia, has provided a secure
          economic income for 2500 women and their indigenous communities.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          In 1996, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
          (UNCTAD) launched its BioTrade Initiative, which emphasizes the
          sustainable extraction, production and trade of biodiverse resources,
          and has established a network of partners and small business in over
          80 countries since.

        </br>
        <p>
          The Eudafano Women’s Cooperative, based in Ondangwa Namibia, is
          supported by the Namibian Government and the Gesellschaft für
          Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), in order to successfully grow
          their business in line with the BioTrade Initiative Principles and
          Criteria. The 2500 women currently employed at Eudafano Women’s
          Cooperative are sustainably harvesting and processing Marula seeds
          and Kalahari melon oil seeds.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Marula is a tree that is native to Southern Africa and Madagascar.
          Due to its oil’s linoleic fatty acid and oleic acid content, as well
          as its antioxidant properties, it is extremely beneficial to nourishing
          healthy human skin. Additionally, marula oils can preserve meat, and
          be added to popular foods and drinks.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘Not only is this a sustainable business, it is entirely made up of
          and led by indigenous and local women.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The Eudafano Women’s Cooperative grows Marula and Kalahari melon trees,
          which are sustained via rainfall and regenerative agriculture. The
          trees are planted in such a way which conserves local biodiversity,
          rather than degrading it to create major plantations—as seen in palm
          oil production. The company sells their oils to both domestic and
          international businesses for cosmetic use, their largest client
          currently including the international giant, The Body Shop.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The Ondangwa women produce up to 12 tons of Marula oil annually,
          generating a revenue of $158,000 in 2020—which is a 14% increase from
          the previous year. Not only is this a sustainable business, it is
          entirely made up of and led by indigenous and local women.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The growth of their business has been increasing each year; its
          success being attributed to their reliance on their employees’
          knowledge about their local environment and their long-established
          practices that prevent overexploitation of natural resources.

          What is the BioTrade Initiative?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The BioTrade Initiative aims to provide a framework which places
          biodiversity as the central natural capital in a green economy model.
          It promotes a sustainable strategy for the extraction, trade and use
          of bio-diversity derived products, which is in line with the objectives
          set out by the Convention on Biological Diversity.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The BioTrade Initiative framework uses three approaches to carry out
          their objectives: (1) The ecosystems approach, (2) the adaptive
          management approach and (3) the value chain approach. The
          <i> ecosystem-based approach </i> manages the sustainable use of
          ecosystems by placing protective policies on the ecosystem as a whole,
          as opposed to a species-based conservation approach. Ecosystems are
          deeply interconnected, thus it is vital to keep a balance between all
          organisms, to ensure its health and resilience, as well as the local
          communities which rely on it.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘A framework which places biodiversity as the central natural capital
          in a green economy model.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The <i> adaptive management approach </i> is the use of guidelines that have
          been set out by scientific research and data collection, which
          identifies and measures the impact of certain practices on the local
          environment. Putting scientific findings into practice, allows one to
          design ways to either reduce negative environmental impacts or mitigate them.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Finally, the <i> value chain approach </i> seeks to strengthen and
          increase the transparency of value chains of biodiversity-derived
          products. This involves equal sharing the environmental, social and
          economic benefits of the end product amongst all who were involved in
          the entire production process.
        </p>

        </br>
        <p>
          Transparency of companies is key to marketing their social corporate
          responsibility and thus expanding a sustainable business. BioTrade
          companies or partner websites need accounts of who is involved in the
          creation of their product, the quality of their employees’ work
          environment and the equitable share they receive from any economic
          benefits. Companies should also explain in detail the sustainable
          methods used to create their products and prove these are backed by
          scientific evidence.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The BioTrade Initiative works by approaching companies or people
          groups and offering them to sell goods and services (ie., textiles,
          handicrafts, cosmetics, phytopharmaceuticals and ecotourism), which
          have been produced in an environmentally and human-friendly way. Over
          time, the goal is for these companies to then shift the majority of
          their investments to solely BioTrade products.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘Transparency of companies is key to marketing their social corporate responsibility.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Currently the Namibian economy largely generates its revenue from
          mineral exports—heavily extracting and processing diamond and
          uranium—which accounts for 10% of the country’s GDP. Mining uranium,
          no matter how the extraction is carried out, creates radioactive waste
          which can contaminate the surrounding environment.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          However, Biotrade currently contributes to 4.5% of Namibia’s GDP, and
          is projected to grow to 7% within the next decade. BioTrade in Namibia
          is a significant stepping-stone to transforming the country into a
          green economy, as it involves markets such as indigenous natural
          products, sustainable wildlife, livestock breeding, aquaculture,
          timber forest products and the agricultural harvesting of indigenous
          crops by indigenous people. As such, a green economy offers economic
          development and improved livelihoods for poorer, marginalized communities.

          Potential market growth
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Namibia can continue to expand their Biotrade initiatives by setting
          up similar projects to that of the Eudafano Women’s Cooperative. Other
          products which have the potential to expand their markets are Devil’s
          Claw and Kalahari Moth Silk.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Devil’s Claw has already provided stable jobs to communities in Zambia,
          using the BioTrade framework. As this plant is found in the dry
          climate of the Kalahari Desert, it has potential to generate income
          for communities in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana and
          Angola as well.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘BioTrade incorporates marginalized communities into the market economy.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Devil’s Claw is a plant which has analgesic and anti-inflammatory
          properties, thus its extract can be sold as a phytopharmaceutical
          product. <i> Small </i> plantations of Devil’s Claw can be grown near
          rural communities where the harvesters live. The plant tubers must be
          carefully extracted each spring, in order for the top-roots to remain
          in good condition, as it is from these that the plant will regenerate.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The UNEP states that, ‘the move towards a green economy seeks to
          develop and capitalize on those resources available to the poorest
          segments of the population, incorporating marginalized communities
          into the market economy and ensuring that they receive a fair share of
          the benefits derived from the productive activities in which they engage.’
