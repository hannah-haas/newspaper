        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          The Covid-19 pandemic has shown many city-dwellers tucked away indoors
          the enormous mental health benefits of spending time in nature. And as
          urbanisation takes over the world—with 5.2 billion people estimated to
          live on 1.9 million km2 of urban land by 2030—it is increasingly
          important to design city spaces to accommodate for the health of their
          inhabitants, both human and animal.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          More specifically, this attention on urban green spaces for the public
          also creates an opportunity to make cities more suitable for insect
          pollinators; essential ecosystem players that are being pushed out of
          rural areas due to harmful agricultural practices.

        <p>
          Rates of mood and anxiety disorders are significantly higher in urban
          areas than in rural areas, as cities generally come with higher crime
          rates, more pollution, and a lack of connection to nature. Spending
          time in green spaces generally improves mental health quality, not
          only by encouraging physical exercise which improves mental stability,
          but also through psychological restoration.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          For example, studies have found a positive correlation between city
          inhabitants living near streets lined with a high density of trees and
          reduced antidepressant prescriptions. Even simply viewing greenery
          from a window and having houseplants has been shown to reduce symptoms
          of anxiety and depression.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Theories behind this effect include Attention Restoration Theory,
          which was developed by Rachel and Stephen Kaplan, professors of
          environmental psychology at the University of Michigan. This theory
          suggests that nature’s gentle stimuli induce reflection and therefore
          improve mental wellbeing.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘Urban green spaces clearly have the potential to improve
          the mental health of city-dwellers.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Alternatively, Roger Ulrich’s Stress Recover Theory hypothesizes that
          humans are hardwired to positively respond to nature because this was
          an advantageous trait in ancestral populations, helping them seek
          resource-rich environments. Whatever the mechanism, urban green spaces
          clearly have the potential to improve the mental health of city-dwellers.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          With regard to what kind of greenery humans prefer, people tend to
          take the greatest pleasure in green spaces with water features, flower
          plantings, trees, and open lawns—there is a strong positive association
          between aesthetic preference and mental restoration. Trees, especially,
          seem to have a disproportionate psychological effect, potentially a
          result of their providing security and other resources to early humans.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The public also tends to like spaces they think are highly diverse,
          however there is a large discrepancy between what people think is
          diverse and what is actually diverse. This is potentially due to poor
          general knowledge of ecology. Therefore, simply having large patches
          of greenery benefits humans, with areas of 20% vegetative cover
          lowering depression and stress by up to 11% and 17%, respectively.
          Increasing this vegetative cover in green areas to 30% has the
          potential to reduce anxiety cases by 25%.

        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          City greenspaces offer a home to urban pollinators
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          There is more uncertainty surrounding the extent to which insect
          pollinators are actually affected by urbanisation, and there is
          variation by taxa. Generally, however, there is greater pollinator
          diversity within cities that have more urban greenery, as the
          additional vegetation—floral plantings in particular—provides
          nesting spaces, pollen, and nectar. Insect pollinators gain the
          most from biodiverse urban green spaces, such as urban grasslands,
          rather than pedestrianized and heavily maintained areas such as parks.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Biodiverse plantings with herbaceous vegetation, native weed species,
          and floral species support a variety of pollinator visitors and
          ensure a well-rounded diet, as flower species differ in protein
          content and amino acids. Keeping areas unmown is also important, as
          naturally maintained green spaces have more suitable soil for ground
          nesting pollinators, allow increased access to flowers, and create
          space for butterfly and hoverfly larvae to develop.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          To compare the two, humans generally benefit more from simple green
          cover, trees, and aesthetic features, while benefits to insect
          pollinators depend upon natural maintenance and diverse plantings.
          Although both parties benefit from different urban greenery in
          different ways, city spaces can be designed with everyone in mind.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘Benefits to insect pollinators depend upon natural maintenance and diverse plantings.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Community gardens are an excellent example of this as they support
          high abundances of pollinators—significantly higher than other urban
          landscapes—and those who use them experience lower rates of depression.
          This solution is less than ideal, however, because land in cities is
          an expensive commodity and community gardens are often private.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          It is more feasible in cities for smaller, unbuildable spaces to be
          reclaimed by nature and for existing green spaces to be improved.
          Improving public parks by increasing tree cover, and planting diverse
          green and floral vegetation would increase pollinator visitation whilst
          also attracting humans. While it matters less for people, the
          composition of flora in urban plantings can also be tailored to
          maximise benefits to pollinators.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Seed mixes should be diverse, including native weed species and
          perennial species that provide floral resources year after year without
          needing replanting. Creating more planted meadows would not only
          support pollinator communities, but would also reduce mowing and
          other maintenance costs. Some cities in the USA, for example, have
          implemented greatly successful ‘No Mow May’ schemes, which have
          demonstrated that unmown urban green spaces have three times the bee
          richness and five times the bee abundance of mown areas.
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </br>
        <p>
          Other cities making progress in this area include Edinburgh, Scotland.
          One study overlaid data on pollinator hotspots with areas of health
          deprivation to identify locations where greenery would benefit both
          parties. The Meadow Bristol project also aims to increase sustainability
          and beautify the city simultaneously through urban meadows, including
          wildflower meadows. The wildflower meadows in particular have been
          designed with conservationists acting as advisors, in order to ensure
          species diversity.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          At a time when everything seems to be a trade-off between human gain
          and sustainability, projects like these that combine the interests of
          both people and nature can reframe how we look at conservation. Given
          the recent rise in awareness of mental health issues, and the ongoing
          physical health concerns surrounding obesity and heart disease, urban
          green spaces are a low-cost, preventative solution supporting both
          aspects of human health.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the intrinsic value of nature is often not enough of
          an incentive to invest in conservation, therefore, highlighting these
          socio-economic benefits to humans can hopefully drive more funding
          towards public green spaces.
