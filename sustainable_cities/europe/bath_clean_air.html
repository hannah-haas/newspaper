        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Since 15 March 2021, Bath, United Kingdom, has begun to fine highly
          polluting vehicles driving within their ‘Clean Air Zone’ in an effort
          to bring the city’s atmospheric nitrogen dioxide levels below the
          legal limit.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The legal limit for atmospheric nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the
          UK is 40μg/m<sup>3</sup>. Nitrogen dioxide frequently reaches high concentrations
          in polluted areas and can be harmful towards human health; causing
          inflammation of airways, coughs, shortness of breath, worsening of lung
          and heart conditions and more. According to the UK government, nitrogen
          dioxide pollution contributes to nearly 36,000 deaths in the UK annually.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Nitrogen oxide plays multiple roles in the chemical reactions of
          polluted air. One third of these molecules are estimated to be emitted
          into the atmosphere via combustion reactions in the engines of motor
          vehicles. This is particularly an issue in densely populated cities
          which experience a lot of traffic and the stalling of car engines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many areas in Bath have exceeded this permitted limit. By installing
          air monitors on signs and lamp posts on the side of streets, the city
          has been able to measure their air quality over the past years. In
          2014 the average annual nitrogen dioxide levels reached 44 μg/m<sup>3</sup>,
          whilst in 2019 they were recorded at an annual average of 29 μg/m<sup>3</sup>.
          Bath and North East Somerset were advised by the government to continue
          these decreasing trends by implementing the Bath Clean Air Zone.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The Bath Clean Air Zone operates under the following rules. Coaches,
          Buses, trucks, lorries and private heavy goods vehicles, all using
          either Euro 1-5/V diesel and Euro 1 to 3 petrol, have to pay a daily
          charge of £100 within the Clean Air Zone. Taxis and private car hire,
          minibuses, vans and light goods vehicles using Euro 1-5/V diesel and
          Euro 1-3 petrol are charged daily £9 in the Clean Air Zone.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Those who have outstanding charges or have been fined have 28 days to
          pay, however fines can be reduced from £120 to £40 if paid within the
          first 14 days. Private cars and motorcycles, even those which are used
          for work purposes, are not charged.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Three months into the Clean Air Zone being implemented, nitrogen
          dioxide levels have still been hovering between 22 μg/m<sup>3</sup>
          and 49 μg/m<sup>3</sup> at peak traffic hours between 2pm to 10pm, when
          measured from the 26 June 2021 to 3 July 2021 (data taken from Bath
          and North East Somerset Council website). Since COVID-19 measures have
          eased in the UK and shops have reopened, Bath parking lots which stood
          empty for months are now full every day and the streets are bustling
          with eager shoppers.
        </p>
        </br>

        </br>
        <p>
          Looking at the recent trends, it still seems like Bath is reaching
          high nitrogen dioxide levels during their rush hours. However, daily
          fluctuations could still even out to an annual average which is below
          the 40μg/m<sup>3</sup> limit. This can only be estimated with time
          and accurate predictions.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          By choosing Class C Charges strategy, the city opted for the option
          that would allow as many cars as possible to be exempt from the rule,
          whilst still averaging below the legal maximum concentration. However,
          one can also argue that Bath and North East Somerset council are
          applying charges to the wrong vehicles.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The fact that private cars and motorcycles are exempt from the rule,
          still allows for a massive proportion—probably even the majority—of
          nitrogen dioxide producing vehicles to be unaccounted for. To combat
          pollution, it seems more logical to promote the reliance on public
          transport, in order to transport more people for less emitted nitrogen
          dioxide in the long term. However, buses and coaches are amongst the
          vehicles which are charged £100 daily.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Private cars (unless electric) should be the vehicles which are
          charged more, in order to increase incentive for the public to use
          public transport. In return, public transport prices can be
          significantly reduced, as the demand for these services increases.
          Bath Council could even use the revenue generated from the Clean
          Air Zone charges and fines, to invest into public transport
          infrastructure, in order to make it an economically viable option for
          everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Local businesses which rely on motor vehicles (i.e., vans, lorries,
          light good vehicles) for transport of materials, should either be
          charged less or be exempt from the rule. Whilst non-local businesses
          should still pay the £100 charge for day visits. Additionally, elders
          and individuals with disabilities or should also be exempt from the
          Clean Air Zone charges and allowed to drive private vehicles in the city.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Many studies and some cities, such as Hamburg, Oslo and even Paris,
          have proposed plans to become either fully or partly car free. For such
          large cities, these plans include either having regions of the city
          which ban private cars or having ‘car-free’ days. Making cities car-free
          and increasing pedestrianization, can decrease air pollution, noise
          pollution and temperature. It would also allow for the opportunity to
          increase green spaces in cities, promoting both pollinator biodiversity
          and human mental health.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Bath is a very small and historic city, and for the majority of the
          <i>able</i> public everything can easily be reached within a walking
          distance. Thus, in theory, the Clean Air Zone can be significantly
          expanded towards the outer suburbs. If metropolises are speaking of
          measures to decrease traffic, a small city like Bath has the potential
          to be car-free.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Visiting cars (ie. non-Bath residents) should park in parking lots on
          the outskirts of the small city, and then either walk or have cheap
          public transport connections towards the city center. Visiting
          businesses or private vehicles which need to enter the Clean Air Zone
          should pay the full charge. Once again, both Bath and non-Bath disabled
          residents should be exempt from any charge.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘Bath has the potential to be a car-free city.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Implementing measures to make cities car-free could enact huge strides
          in decreasing air pollution. It could shift the reliance on cars for
          only journeys between cities and the reliance on public transport
          within cities. Though this may seem inconvenient at first, humans are
          very adaptable—if a century ago we did not use cars, then we can
          readjust old habits and take the bus.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          If Bath and North Somerset Council really wants to decrease air
          pollution and improve human health, stricter measures need to be
          implemented. The Clean Air Zone is a good start, though not enough.
          By investing revenues from the charges and fines, as well as government
          funds, into public transport infrastructure, one would allow for better
          connections, environmentally friendly buses, cheaper fares, more
          efficient schedules and better paid employees.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          It is time cities and its people start making sacrifices in their
          habits—as many of them are not necessities. The environment and all
          other of its inhabitants have made involuntary sacrifices for humans;
          it is time we do better. The UK has the money and the technology to
          make its cities greener, by creating solutions which keeps everybody
          in mind.
