          Food is a right and necessity for all living organisms. However, with
          the projected exponential population growth of humans and a somewhat
          ‘unpredictable’ changing climate, our world is facing food insecurity.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          New, innovative strategies are needed to increase food production,
          whilst hindering the further exacerbation of climate change. Food
          production must increase by at least 70% in order to meet the global
          food demand in 2050—which is when the global population is projected
          to hit nine billion people. However, with the current climate crisis,
          the depletion of environmental resources and biodiversity loss,
          achieving such a task is no easy feat.

        </br>
        <p>
          One of the major concerns frequently discussed today is our substantial
          consumption of meat; according to an FAO Report (2019), around 80
          billion livestock are slaughtered every year to meet the demand for
          meat products.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Livestock is a primary contributor of greenhouse gas <strong> (GHG)
          </strong> emissions, the major drivers of climate change, due to their
          ruminant guts and their nitrous oxide-filled manure. Today,
          approximately 14.5% of the entire anthropogenic GHG emissions is
          caused by livestock, of which 65% is from cattle (FAO 2019).
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          As the year goes by, global meat demand continues to surge, as
          previously lower income countries become richer and more urbanized.
          The expansion of these markets will further implicate an increase in
          land-use change, freshwater usage, GHG emissions and biodiversity loss.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          To hinder this, wealthier countries, who have the luxury of choice in
          their diets, have strongly encouraged their citizens to shift towards
          plant-based diets—the abstinence from all animal products. The aim is
          to relieve pressure on livestock production, both meat and dairy,
          by decreasing demand.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘80 billion livestock are slaughtered every year to meet the demand for meat products.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          So, should we all go plant-based? In theory, this would be a ‘quick
          fix’ solution to decreasing the impact of GHG emissions on the global
          environment immensely and decelerating global warming.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Although, this is unrealistic and not a ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution.
          In many regions of the world meat is a crucial part of the culture,
          religion, and income. For instance, livestock contributes about 19%,
          13% and 8% GDP in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, respectively.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          One must also keep in mind that it is the diets of urbanized areas
          which contribute the most to climate change, as their demands are
          supplied via factory and battery farms. These high density, intensive
          agricultural practices have little regard for animal wellbeing and the
          environment, prioritizing maximizing their profits instead. It is not
          the subsistence, smallholder farmers of rural and indigenous
          communities, who contribute to GHG emissions.

          Eat Just, Inc. : A lab-based approach to meeting the meat demand
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          We may not be far from a future where meat is consumed without
          slaughtering any live animals nor our finite resources unsustainably
          exploited. For the first time in the world, the Singapore Food Agency
          approved lab-grown chicken (also known as in vitro, artificial meat)
          produced by Californian start-up Eat Just, branded as GOOD Meat.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The founder and CEO of Eat Just, Josh Tetrick, started his company
          with the aim to ‘take live animals out of the equation of the food
          system’. Their featured product ‘Just Egg’ launched in 2018, which
          has been lab-grown to mimic chicken eggs. The company has been able
          to sell an equivalent of more than 100 million chicken eggs to firms
          such as Walmart and Alibaba.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          This <i> cultured </i> chicken is not plant-based, as its contents are
          <i> technically </i> still made from animals. Eat Just’s poultry meat
          and egg products are cultured from a single stem cell—a non-specialised
          cell which can be programmed to grow into any part of the body—obtained
          from a cell bank, through a biopsy or the root of a feather.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The cell is then fed with all the essential nutrients and hormones,
          as a chicken normally would. Depending on the manufacturer’s choice,
          stem cells can then either transform into muscle cells or fat cells.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘For the first time in the world, the Singapore Food Agency approved
          lab-grown chicken.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          With this technique, one could grow the desired part of chicken,
          whilst eliminating the need to produce, keep and slaughter live
          chicken in battery farms. It takes around two weeks to obtain full
          grown meat and the process is relatively easy compared to its
          regulatory approval to be allowed onto the market.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          So, where can you have your bite of the lab-grown chicken? Currently,
          only one restaurant in Singapore, 1880 is serving GOOD Meat chicken
          nuggets for about $17. However, there is expected to be a wider
          adoption of cultured chicken in the city over the coming months to
          years. Furthermore, it is possible to purchase such chicken on the
          <a target="_blank" style="color: rgb(150, 186, 143);" href="https://goodmeat.co/">
            GOOD Meat website. </a>
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          This breakthrough of approving lab-based meat has not only shaken the
          world of animal agriculture, but is revolutionizing it. Although
          poultry production represents only the minority of the total livestock
          GHG emission (8%), if cultured beef and pork meat are also approved,
          it would significantly contribute to the climate crisis mitigation,
          whilst meeting the global meat demand.
        </p>

            Scientists can mimic the growth conditions in the lab in order to
            grow chicken meat and eggs from a single stem cell. Only a few
            chickens, or livestock in general, would be needed as a stem cell
            bank — a tiny proportion of the livestock we rear today. | Nighthawk

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </br>
        <p>
          What are the other benefits? Wider adoption of cultured meat means
          that some animal welfare issues can be overcome, and biodiversity can
          be maintained by sparing the land used for feed crops and livestock
          rearing. Moreover, cultured meat could substitute plant-based meat
          products which often fail to satisfy consumers on their texture,
          consistency and taste.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          But, how would the world respond to this novel method of producing
          meat? Oftentimes, humans tend to dislike ‘unnatural’ products, which
          may influence the acceptance of lab-grown meat.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Furthermore, despite some of the ethical issues of livestock farming
          being tackled, certain cellular agriculture still requires a much
          smaller extent of animal rearing to extract muscle cell samples—regardless
          of the little to no pain caused. As a result, some may still choose to
          be vegetarian or vegan.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Is cultured meat safe?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Advocates of cultured meat argue that it is safer than the current
          meat sold in supermarkets, as it is grown under a controlled environment
          without any external contacts. Thus, <i> in vitro </i> meat has
          extremely low or no risk of bacterial contamination such as <i> E.coli,
            Salmonella or Campylobacter, </i> compared to conventional, highly dense
          livestock during slaughter. This technology would also decrease the
          pressure on antibiotic-resistance development.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          On the other hand, there is a lot of uncertainty in potential
          consequences of cultured meat due to its recent development. Some may
          argue that human metabolism could severely be affected if cultured
          meat containing deregulated cell lines are consumed. But, it is perhaps
          not so much of a concern, as this would be relatively easy to spot and
          removed from production.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          In terms of the environment, the carbon footprint from cultured meat
          may not be as better than conventional livestock farming over the
          long term as initially thought. A study reported that despite methane
          from live animals being one of the most potent GHGs, it does not
          accumulate in the atmosphere like CO<sub>2</sub> does.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Therefore, if one replaces livestock entirely with cultured meat,
          CO<sub>2</sub> from the production would gradually accumulate and
          remain, warming the temperature. Thus, the advantage of <i> in vitro </i>
          meat over conventional animal agriculture is not always clear.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlighted_info_right">
          ‘<i>In vitro </i> meat has extremely low or no risk of bacterial contamination.’
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Other limiting factors are cost and scale of its production. Currently,
          it costs $4 to produce 110 grams of cultured chicken, compared to the
          $1.14 per Kg in conventional chicken farms. However, CEO from Future
          Meat Technologies, Rom Kshuk predicts that the price would be cut back
          under $2 over the next year or so.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Eat Just CEO Tetrick is also confident that cultured chicken production
          cost and scale would significantly improve over time. But, it would
          take several years or more for this high-priced product to become
          accessible to all.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          We must also consider the consequences of cellular agriculture on
          conventional farmers, religion and culture. If livestock agriculture
          is eliminated, a loss of agricultural jobs and livelihood is
          inevitable—with those in poorer countries having a difficult time to
          find alternative work.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          Another interesting question is whether lab-grown meat would be
          considered as <i> Kosher </i> (Jewish dietary law) or <i> Halal </i>
          (Islamic dietary law)? Some argue that regardless of the source of
          meat cells used, the original identity would be lost.

        </br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          So where is the world heading?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The approval of sustainable lab-grown chicken by Singapore has
          undeniably become a turning point of our broken food systems, and a
          big step towards achieving food security. However, it is believed that
          it will take several years for the US and Europe to approve cellular
          agriculture for market sale, due to strict regulatory legislations and
          public attitudes.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          But Tetrick is confident, ‘You have to take leaps of faith every day,
          right? We’re acting as if the U.S. will eventually approve it. We’re
          acting as if Europe will eventually approve it.’
